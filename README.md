# Beer Recipe Editor

This is a project we've started at the [Brasserie du Vieux
Singe](https://www.vieuxsinge.com) in order to work on our recipes with
a software under our control.

It aims to be simple to use and easy to hack on. It's built with web
technologies we know and love (especially when they don't get in the way!)

You can try it at https://editor.vieuxsinge.com, have fun!
